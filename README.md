Lego Technic Space Shuttle. That is when my interest in problem solving began. When my brother got the kit for Christmas and he was not particularly interested in building it, I took over and I worked on it for weeks every day after school. I was fascinated to build something complex with the simple, tiny blocks.

For many years, I was following my passion for literature and theatre, but this memory of building the space shuttle and the urge to make a difference through solving problems eventually led me to start teaching myself to code.

Makers Academy's Fellowship Program made it possible to take this ambition further, and after four months of intensive programming, I am looking for my first software developer job that will constantly challenge me to learn more, renew and improve.

## Skills

**Leading, motivating, and managing teams:**

* As a Theatre Supervisor, I was responsible for providing excellent customer service and reaching company targets while also creating fun, dynamic working environment for the employees. I organised several themed incentives and team building activities to motivate our Front of House team.
* As a Senior Activity Leader at the Leicester Children's Holiday Centre, I was training and coordinating a culturally and linguistically diverse team of activity leaders and volunteers for six summer seasons.

**Communication:**

* As a Duty Manager and Supervisor, I frequently had to respond to customer related issues in a positive, constructive manner
* I was the designated Access Host at the theatre, making sure our access patrons were comfortable and looked after at all times
* Managing children with difficult behaviour and ADHD can be challenging. Being patient and a good listener really helped me to understand and guide them better.

**Persistent and curious learner:**
* At age 5 I taught myself to read and since then I have never stopped looking for opportunities to continue growing, learning, and improving.
* To make sure I had a complex understanding of the subject I was studying, I completed four university degrees. In the meantime and since then, I have also signed up for workshops and short courses in various fields like audio description or fund raising to expand my knowledge and discover new things.
