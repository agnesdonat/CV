Agnes Donat

I like to think of myself as an explorer constantly pushing my boundaries to have a better understanding of myself and the world around me.
For ten years, I have been mainly working in customer service and arts management, but eventually, the urge to make a difference led me to teach myself how to code.
I am looking for a career change that constantly challenges me to renew and improve.
